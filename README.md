# WCAT Oath
We swear to use free and open source systems to maintain digital accessibility standards and, when possible, we will contribute time to building and maintaining the free and open source systems that we use. 

We understand "free and open source systems" as being systems with [approved open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/). Any truly free and open source work also does not license its material under "dual licenses," meaning we do not support work that includes additional protections for selling and gaurding work beyond the protections outlined in the approved open source license.
